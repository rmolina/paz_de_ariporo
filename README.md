- `traj3d.py` computes the Lagrangian trajectories.
- `traj3d_loop.py` calculates all the trajectories for a year.
- `ellipses_convexhulls_fractions.py` analyzes the trajectories: It calculates the set of standard deviational ellipses and their convex hulls, and estimates the forest, land, and ocean fractions for each convex hull.
